# Tumult — A Warhammer Narrative Campaign

> In this competitive, map-based campaign, rival warlords vie to conquer the chaotic Border Princes through strategic maneuvering and tactical prowess. Alliances are temporary, and only one will reign supreme.

## What to Expect

This campaign is designed to be a dynamic and narrative-driven experience. Here are some of the key features that make it different:

*   **Asymmetrical Battles**: Forget fixed point values. The strategic situation on the map directly determines your army size, leading to unique and challenging battles. An 850-point army might face a 1200-point horde if they're defending a critical fortress.
*   **Creative Army Building**: The unusual point totals will challenge you to think outside the box and create flexible, adaptable army lists rather than relying on standard tournament builds.
*   **Strategic Depth**: You'll need to manage multiple armies, predict your opponents' secret moves, and decide when to concentrate your forces or spread them out to control territory.
*   **Evolving Heroes**: Your warlord will grow and change over the campaign, gaining unique traits—and even injuries—that tell a story. Progression is about interesting choices, not just bigger stats.

## The Campaign Map

The campaign is played on a map of named locations called **Nodes**, connected by **Routes**.

*   **Nodes**: These are territories you fight to control. Each Node has a Supply Value, which represents the size of the army it can support.
    *   **Village**: 250 Supply
    *   **Town**: 500 Supply
    *   **Fortress**: 800 Supply
    *   **Capital**: 1000 Supply
*   **Routes**: These are the paths that connect Nodes. Your armies can only move between Nodes that are connected by a Route.

## The Campaign Turn

Each campaign turn is broken down into five phases.

### Phase 1: Downtime Phase (Private)

In this phase, you manage your army and plan your strategy in secret.

*   **Spend Gold**: Replenish losses from your existing units or purchase new units to add to your Army Roster.
*   **Spend Renown**: Upgrade your Hero by acquiring new, powerful traits.
*   **Plan Moves**: Decide on the secret orders you will issue to your armies this turn.

### Phase 2: Secret Orders Phase

Secretly write down one order for each of your armies (your Main Army and any Regiments) and submit it to the Game Master.

*   **Move**: Move an army to an adjacent, connected Node.
*   **Defend**: The army remains in its current Node, ready to repel an attack. If an army under a "Defend" order is attacked, its player may choose one of the following bonuses before the battle begins:
    * **Favourable Ground**: You may choose your deployment zone.
    * **Prepared Ambuscade**: Grant one of your Core units the Vanguard special rule for this battle.
    * **Ready for the Assault**: You gain a +1 modifier on the roll to determine who takes the first turn.
*   **Create Regiment**: Split an army into two. You must specify which units are assigned to the new Regiment.
*   **Merge Regiment**: Combine your army and a friendly Regiment in the same Node into a single force.

### Phase 3: Order Resolution Phase

The Game Master reveals and resolves all orders simultaneously. This can lead to battles.

*   **Uncontested Move**: Your army moves into a vacant or friendly node.
*   **Challenge**: Your army moves into a node where an enemy is Defending, starting a battle.
*   **Head-on-Clash**: Your army and an enemy army try to swap nodes. The battle immediately occurs at the node with the higher base Supply Value. Both armies calculate their fieldable army size based on this new location.
*   **Contested Target**: Two or more armies move to the same destination node. This triggers a Standoff.

#### Standoff Resolution

When a Contested Target occurs, the involved players must immediately submit a new secret order:

*   **Stand and Fight**: Your army holds its ground, ready for battle.
*   **Withdraw**: Your army retreats to the node it came from.

The choice is a gamble. If all players involved choose to **Withdraw**, everyone returns to their starting node safely. However, if even one player chooses to **Stand and Fight**, a battle is triggered. All armies that moved to the node, including those that chose to Withdraw, are immediately drawn into the fight along with any defending army. The winner takes the node.

### Phase 4: Battle Phase

All battles from the Order Resolution Phase are fought now.

### Phase 5: Resolution Phase (Public)

The results of the turn are made public.

*   **Update Map & Handle Retreats**: The winner of a battle takes control of the contested node.
    *   **If the Attacker Loses**: Your army is repelled and returns to the node it came from.
    *   **If the Defender Loses**: Your army must retreat to an adjacent, friendly node. If there is no safe path of retreat, your army is scattered, and all its units are permanently lost.
*   **Award Renown**: Heroes involved in battles earn Renown.
*   **Collect Revenue**: You gain Gold Crowns for each Node you control.

## Army Management & Supply

### Army Roster

This is your master list of all the units you own. It grows when you recruit new units and shrinks when they are permanently destroyed.

### Calculating Fieldable Army Size

Your army's size for a battle is determined by the Supply Value of the territory it's in, using the **Decimal Contribution System**:

*   **100%** of the Supply from your army's current Node.
*   **10%** of the Supply from each adjacent, friendly Node.
*   **1%** of the Supply from each friendly Node two spaces away.

### Splitting Forces

You can field one **Main Army** led by your Hero and multiple smaller **Regiments**. When you create a Regiment, you assign units from your Army Roster to it. These units are tied to that Regiment until you merge it back into another army.

## Determining Battle Size

*   **Calculate Supply**: Both players calculate their army size using the Decimal Contribution System.
*   **500-Point Floor**: If either player’s calculated Supply is below 500, it is raised to 500.
*   The battle is fought with these final, adjusted army sizes.

**Examples:**
*   Player A (800 Supply) vs. Player B (650 Supply) -> **800 vs. 650**
*   Player A (700 Supply) vs. Player B (350 Supply) -> **700 vs. 500**
*   Player A (400 Supply) vs. Player B (250 Supply) -> **500 vs. 500**

## Hero Progression

Your Hero grows by spending Renown earned from battles to acquire traits. These traits offer powerful bonuses, but often come with thematic downsides. If your Hero is slain, they are not killed, but may gain an Injury Trait that reflects their scars while granting a unique benefit.

### Example Traits

*   **Arrogant**: The Hero gains the **Hatred** special rule, but must always issue and accept challenges.
*   **Lost Eye**: The Hero suffers -1 to their Ballistic Skill, but their unit becomes immune to Panic caused by shooting.
*   **Limping Leg**: The Hero suffers -1 to their Movement, but gains the **Stubborn** special rule.

## Victory

The campaign ends when a player achieves one of the pre-determined victory conditions, such as controlling specific territories, eliminating another player, or having the most Renown after a set number of turns.
