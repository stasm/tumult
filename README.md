# Tumult — A Warhammer Narrative Campaign

> In this competitive, map-based campaign, rival warlords vie to conquer the chaotic Border Princes through strategic maneuvering and tactical prowess. Alliances are temporary, and only one will reign supreme.

## What to Expect

This campaign is designed to be a dynamic and narrative-driven experience. Here are some of the key features that make it different:

*   **Asymmetrical Battles**: Forget fixed point values. The strategic situation on the map directly determines your army size, leading to unique and challenging battles. An 850-point army might face a 1200-point horde if they're defending a critical fortress.
*   **Creative Army Building**: The unusual point totals will challenge you to think outside the box and create flexible, adaptable army lists rather than relying on standard tournament builds.
*   **Focus on Territory**: Victory comes from controlling a wide and contiguous empire that fuels your war effort, not from chasing individual armies across the map. Your strategic position is more important than any single tactical victory.
*   **Simultaneous Secret Orders**: All players submit their orders in secret, leading to a tense resolution phase filled with bluffs, gambles, and unexpected standoffs.
*   **Evolving Heroes**: Your warlord will grow and change over the campaign, gaining unique traits—and even injuries—that tell a story. Progression is about interesting choices, not just bigger stats.
