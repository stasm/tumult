# Tumult — A Warhammer Narrative Campaign

> In this competitive, map-based campaign, rival warlords vie to conquer the chaotic Border Princes through strategic maneuvering and tactical prowess. Alliances are temporary, and only one will reign supreme.

## What to Expect

This campaign is designed to be a dynamic and narrative-driven experience. Here are some of its key features:

*   **Focus on Territory**: Victory comes from controlling a wide and contiguous empire that fuels your war effort, not from chasing individual armies across the map. Your strategic position is more important than any single tactical victory.
*   **Asymmetrical Battles**: Forget fixed point values. The strategic situation on the map directly determines your army size, leading to unique and challenging battles. The more territory you control, the larger army you can field, leading to slightly imbalanced matchups which fuel the narrative.
*   **Creative Army Building**: The unusual point totals (e.g. 837 vs. 904 points) will challenge you to think outside the box and create flexible, adaptable army lists rather than relying on standard tournament builds.
*   **Simultaneous Secret Orders**: All players submit their orders in secret, leading to a tense resolution phase filled with bluffs, gambles, and unexpected standoffs.
*   **Evolving Heroes**: Your warlord will grow and change over the campaign, gaining unique traits—and even injuries—that tell a story. Progression is about interesting choices, not just bigger stats.
