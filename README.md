# Tumult — A Warhammer Narrative Campaign

> In this competitive, map-based campaign, rival warlords vie to conquer the chaotic Border Princes through strategic maneuvering and tactical prowess. Alliances are temporary, and only one will reign supreme.

## What to Expect

This campaign is designed to be a dynamic and narrative-driven experience. Here are some of the key features that make it different:

*   **Asymmetrical Battles**: Forget fixed point values. The strategic situation on the map directly determines your army size, leading to unique and challenging battles. An 850-point army might face a 1200-point horde if they're defending a critical fortress.
*   **Creative Army Building**: The unusual point totals will challenge you to think outside the box and create flexible, adaptable army lists rather than relying on standard tournament builds.
*   **Focus on Territory**: Victory comes from controlling a wide and contiguous empire that fuels your war effort, not from chasing individual armies across the map. Your strategic position is more important than any single tactical victory.
*   **Simultaneous Secret Orders**: All players submit their orders in secret, leading to a tense resolution phase filled with bluffs, gambles, and unexpected standoffs.
*   **Evolving Heroes**: Your warlord will grow and change over the campaign, gaining unique traits—and even injuries—that tell a story. Progression is about interesting choices, not just bigger stats.

## The Campaign Map

The campaign is played on a map of named locations, connected by **Routes**.

*   **Locations**: These are territories you fight to control. Each Location has a Supply Value, which represents the size of the army it can support.
    *   **Village**: 250 Supply
    *   **Town**: 500 Supply
    *   **Fortress**: 800 Supply
    *   **Capital**: 1000 Supply
*   **Routes**: These are the paths that connect Locations.

## The Campaign Turn

Each campaign turn is broken down into five phases.

### Phase 1: Downtime Phase (Private)

In this phase, you manage your army and plan your strategy in secret.

*   **Spend Gold**: Replenish losses from your existing units or purchase new units to add to your Army Roster.
*   **Spend Renown**: Upgrade your Hero by acquiring new, powerful traits.
*   **Plan Attacks**: Decide on the secret orders you will issue to your armies this turn.

### Phase 2: Secret Orders Phase

Secretly write down one **Attack** order and submit it to the Game Master. Each player may only issue one Attack order per turn.

### Phase 3: Order Resolution Phase

The Game Master reveals and resolves all orders simultaneously. This can lead to battles.

*   **Uncontested Attack**: If a Location is attacked by only one player, a battle is initiated between the attacker and the defending player.
*   **Contested Attack**: If a Location is attacked by two or more players simultaneously, this triggers a **Standoff**.

#### Standoff Resolution

When a Standoff occurs, the involved players (including the defender) must immediately and secretly submit a new order:

*   **Stand and Fight**: The player commits to a battle for the Location.
*   **Withdraw**: The player pulls their forces back, ceding the Location to their rivals.

If all involved players choose to Withdraw, the Location remains in the defender's hands. However, if at least one player chooses to Stand and Fight, a battle is initiated. All players involved in the Standoff (including those who chose to Withdraw) are drawn into the battle. The winner takes control of the Location.

### Phase 4: Battle Phase

All battles from the Order Resolution Phase are fought now.

### Phase 5: Resolution Phase (Public)

The results of the turn are made public.

*   **Update Map Control**: The winner of a battle takes control of the contested Location.
*   **Award Renown**: Heroes involved in battles earn Renown.
*   **Collect Revenue**: You gain Gold Crowns for each Location you control.

## Armies & Supply

In Tumult, armies are an abstract representation of a player's military might, not physical pieces on the map. A player's forces are represented by their **Army Roster**, which is a master list of all the units they command.

When a battle is fought, players muster an army for that specific engagement by choosing units from their Army Roster. The same units and heroes can be used in multiple battles during the same campaign turn.

## Calculating Battle Size

The maximum size of an army in any given battle is determined by the **Supply Value** of the Location where the battle is taking place. This is calculated using the **Decimal Contribution System**.

To calculate the maximum points for a battle at a specific Location (the "battleground"):

*   **Attacker's Maximum Army Size**:
    *   100% of the Supply Value of the battleground Location.
    *   10% of the Supply Value from each adjacent, friendly-controlled Location.
    *   1% of the Supply Value from each second-degree friendly-controlled Location.

*   **Defender's Maximum Army Size**:
    *   100% of the Supply Value of the battleground Location.
    *   10% of the Supply Value from each adjacent, friendly-controlled Location.
    *   1% of the Supply Value from each second-degree friendly-controlled Location.

Once both players have calculated their maximum army size, a 500-point floor is applied.

*   **Apply 500-Point Floor**: If a player’s calculated maximum army size is below 500, it is raised to 500. Otherwise, they use their full calculated value.

Players then muster an army for the battle, ensuring their army's total points value does not exceed their calculated maximum.

## Hero Progression

Your Hero grows by spending Renown earned from battles to acquire traits. These traits offer powerful bonuses, but often come with thematic downsides. If your Hero is slain, they are not killed, but may gain an Injury Trait that reflects their scars while granting a unique benefit.

### Example Traits

*   **Arrogant**: The Hero gains the **Hatred** special rule, but must always issue and accept challenges.
*   **Lost Eye**: The Hero suffers -1 to their Ballistic Skill, but their unit becomes immune to Panic caused by shooting.
*   **Limping Leg**: The Hero suffers -1 to their Movement, but gains the **Stubborn** special rule.

## Victory

The campaign ends when a player achieves one of the pre-determined victory conditions, such as controlling specific territories, eliminating another player, or having the most Renown after a set number of turns.
