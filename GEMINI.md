# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the rules and design documents for **Tumult**, a narrative campaign for the tabletop wargame **Warhammer: The Old World**. This is not a software project, but a collection of documents that describe a ruleset for a map-based campaign.

## Development Workflow

The core design work for this project happens in the `design` directory. The documents within this directory contain the design goals, mechanics, and rules that are being developed and refined. They may contain incomplete or experimental ideas that are not yet ready for release, as well as discussion of alternative approaches and potential improvements.

The `rules` directory contains the user-facing, "release" version of the rules, extracted and refined from the design documents. The root `README.md` file is the entry-point to the user-facing rules.

## Key Files

### Design Documents

*   `design/README.md`: This file provides a high-level overview of the design goals for the campaign. **It is very important to keep these goals in mind when making any changes.**
*   `design/progression_traits.md`: This document explains the hero progression system, which is based on acquiring "Traits" that provide bonuses and sometimes thematic downsides.
*   `design/region_bonuses.md`: This document details the concept of Region Control Bonuses.

### Rules Documents

These documents contain the comprehensive, user-facing rules for the campaign.

*   `rules/turn_phases.md`: This document provides a detailed breakdown of the five phases of a campaign turn: Downtime, Secret Orders, Order Resolution, Battle, and Resolution.
*   `rules/map_supply.md`: This document details the campaign map, the concept of "Supply" for determining army sizes, and the "Decimal Contribution System" for calculating it.
*   `rules/roster_management.md`: This document outlines the rules for managing your Army Roster, recruiting new troops, and replenishing losses.
*   `rules/hero_progression.md`: This document explains the hero progression system, which is based on acquiring "Traits" that provide bonuses and sometimes thematic downsides.

### User-Facing Rulebook Entry Point

*   `README.md`: This is the main rulebook for the campaign. It contains a comprehensive overview of the rules, including the campaign turn structure, army management, battle size calculation, and hero progression, and links to the detailed rules documents.

## Usage

The contents of this directory are intended to be used as a rule set for playing the Tumult Warhammer narrative campaign. The `README.md` file is the primary document to read for the current rules, while the files in the `design` directory provide the underlying design and rationale, and the `rules` directory contains the detailed rule sets.
