# Hero Progression

Your Hero grows by spending Renown earned from battles to acquire traits. These traits offer powerful bonuses, but often come with thematic downsides. If your Hero is slain, they are not killed, but may gain an Injury Trait that reflects their scars while granting a unique benefit.

## Example Traits

*   **Arrogant**: The Hero gains the **Hatred** special rule, but must always issue and accept challenges.
*   **Lost Eye**: The Hero suffers -1 to their Ballistic Skill, but their unit becomes immune to Panic caused by shooting.
*   **Limping Leg**: The Hero suffers -1 to their Movement, but gains the **Stubborn** special rule.
