# Campaign Turn & Phases

## The Campaign Turn

The campaign proceeds in four phases, forming a complete cycle of planning, action, and resolution.

### Phase 1: Downtime (Private)

Players manage their forces, plan their next moves, and issue their secret orders for the turn. Players are trusted to keep their own records of Gold, Renown, and their current Army Roster.

*   **Spend Gold**: Replenish losses from existing units or purchase new units for your Army Roster.
*   **Spend Renown**: Upgrade your Hero with new traits.
*   **Issue Secret Orders**: Each player secretly writes down their order for the turn and gives it to the GM. The only available order is **Attack**. Each player may only issue one Attack order per turn. To initiate a battle, you issue an "Attack" order, specifying the target Location you intend to capture.

### Phase 2: Reveal

The GM reveals and resolves all orders simultaneously.

*   **Uncontested Attack**: If a Location is attacked by only one player, a battle is initiated between the attacker and the defending player.
*   **Contested Attack**: If a Location is attacked by two or more players simultaneously, this triggers a **Standoff**.

#### Standoff Resolution for Contested Attacks

When a Standoff occurs, the main turn is paused. The involved players (including the defender) must immediately and secretly submit a new order to the GM from the following options:

*   **Stand and Fight**: The player commits to a battle for the Location.
*   **Withdraw**: The player pulls their forces back, ceding the Location to their rivals.

**Resolution:**

*   **If all involved players choose to Withdraw**: The Location remains in the defender's hands. The turn proceeds.
*   **If at least one player chooses to Stand and Fight**: A battle is initiated. All players involved in the Standoff (including those who chose to Withdraw) are drawn into the battle. The winner takes control of the Location.

### Phase 3: Battle

Resolve all battles initiated in the Order Resolution Phase. For each battle, players muster an army from their Army Roster, adhering to the calculated battle size for the Location.

### Phase 4: Update

This phase resolves the results of the turn's actions in full view of all players.

*   **Update Map Control**: The winner of a battle takes control of the contested Location. If the defender loses, they no longer control the Location. There is no "retreat" in the physical sense, as armies are not tokens on the map.
*   **Award Renown**: Heroes involved in the turn's battles earn Renown.
*   **Collect Revenue**: Gain Gold Crowns for each Location you currently control. This income is available to spend in the next turn's Downtime Phase.

## Progression & Victory

*   **Army Progression**: Armies grow by spending Gold on new units for the master Roster.
*   **Victory**: The campaign ends when a player achieves a pre-determined condition: Domination (controlling set territories), Warlord King (eliminating another player), or Timed Victory (most Renown/territories after a set of turns).
