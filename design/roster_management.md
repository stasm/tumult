# Roster, Recruitment & Reinforcement

This document outlines the rules for managing your Army Roster, recruiting new troops, and replenishing losses. The system is designed to be dynamic, creating a narrative for your units as they survive, grow, and face the risk of permanent destruction.

## The Army Roster

Your Army Roster is a list of all the units available to your warlord. Unlike a standard army list, the roster does not track upgrades or command groups. Instead, for each unit type, it simply tracks the total number of models you have available. This is the unit's **Established Size**.

**Example Roster:**
*   High Elf Spearmen: 42
*   Silver Helms: 5
*   Lothern Sea Guard: 20
*   Eagle Claw Bolt Thrower: 1
*   Archmage: 1

## The Lifecycle of a Unit: A Campaign Turn

The unit's **Established Size** determines the total number of models you have available for that unit type when mustering an army for a battle. It also determines the maximum number of models you can replenish at a reduced cost after the battle. Note that it's only possible to replenish units in the downtime phase directly following a battle. The number you replenish to becomes the unit's new **Established Size**.

To understand how the roster changes, let's follow a unit of Spearmen through a full campaign turn.

**1. Start of the Turn**
*   We look at your Army Roster. It says you have **42 Spearmen**. This is your "Established Size" for this turn.

**2. The Battle Phase**
*   You choose to field a unit of 30 of your Spearmen in a battle.
*   During the fight, the unit takes 10 casualties.

**3. The Resolution Phase (After the Battle)**
*   The 10 casualties are immediately removed from your roster.
*   Your roster is updated. It now shows you have **32 Spearmen** (42 - 10 = 32).

**4. The Downtime Phase (Next Turn)**
*   Now, you can spend Gold to reinforce your Spearmen. You have 10 casualties that are eligible for the cheaper "Replenish Veterans" rate.
*   You decide to replenish 8 of the 10 casualties. This costs you the discounted rate.
*   Your roster is updated. Your Spearmen unit now has **40 models** (32 + 8). This becomes its new **Established Size** for the next turn. The 2 models you chose not to replenish are permanently lost from the veteran unit.

## Special Cases: Permanent Losses

The risk of losing a unit forever is what makes their survival meaningful.

*   **If a unit is completely wiped out in battle**: Its Established Size on the roster drops to **0**. The veteran formation is gone. You can no longer use the cheaper "Replenish" option for this unit type; you can only "Recruit" a new one at full price.
*   **If a unit flees off the map**: Its Established Size is immediately reduced to the number of models that successfully fled. You **cannot** replenish the models that were lost before the unit broke. You can only add new models to the depleted unit by "Recruiting" them at full price.

## Starting the Campaign

*   At the beginning of the campaign, all players receive a starting treasury of **1000 Gold**.
*   They use this Gold to purchase their initial units and establish their starting Army Roster, paying the full price of 1 Gold per 1 Point of a model's cost.
