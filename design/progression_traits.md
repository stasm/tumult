# Hero Progression & Trait Design

Heroes evolve by spending Renown earned from battles. Instead of simple stat increases, Renown is used to acquire new traits that provide bonuses, often with thematic downsides. When a Hero is slain in battle, they are considered injured. They may gain disability traits that reflect their scars but can also grant unique benefits, creating a rich, evolving story for each character.

## Trait Design Toolbox

The following mechanical "levers" can be used to create unique Hero traits.

1. Tabletop Effects (During Battle):
	•	Hero-Specific: Adjust a Hero's stats (M, WS, Ld, etc.), grant them Universal Special Rules (Hatred, Stubborn), or modify their equipment's performance.
	•	Unit-Level: Grant a special rule (Vanguard, Immune to Psychology) or a passive aura (+1 Combat Resolution, re-roll Break tests) to the unit the Hero has joined.
	•	Army-Level: Extend the General's command range, allow a pre-battle redeployment, or grant a bonus to the first-turn roll.

2. Roster Effects (Pre-Battle):

	•	Force Organisation: Alter the number of Core, Special, or Rare slots available, or allow a unit to count as a different category (e.g., Special to Core).
	•	Unit Costing: Make specific units or upgrades (musicians, shields) cheaper or free for the army.
	•	Equipment Options: Unlock or restrict wargear options for the Hero or specific units.

3. Campaign Effects (Outside of Battle):

	•	Economy: Modify the Gold or Supply income from controlled Locations, or change the cost to recruit/replenish units.
	•	Strategy & Intelligence: Allow faster movement on the map, or grant intelligence about an opponent's Secret Order.
	•	Persistence: Change the rules for unit recovery, such as allowing a completely destroyed unit to be "re-formed" at a reduced cost.

## Example Traits

The following are examples of the kinds of traits a Hero can acquire.

Personality Traits

	•	Arrogant: The Hero gains the Hatred special rule, but must always issue and accept challenges if possible.
	•	Greedy: The Hero earns an extra 1D6x10 Gold Crowns after winning a battle, but the Hero and their unit can never refuse an opportunity to pursue a fleeing enemy.
	•	Cautious: The Hero's unit can re-roll any failed Break tests, but may never declare a charge on the first turn of a combat.

Injury Traits

	•	Lost Eye: The Hero suffers a permanent -1 penalty to their Ballistic Skill. However, their grim determination makes their unit immune to Panic caused by shooting casualties.
	•	Limping Leg: The Hero suffers a permanent -1 penalty to their Movement characteristic, but gains the Stubbornspecial rule.
	•	Shattered Shield Arm: The Hero can no longer use a shield. Their desperate fighting style now grants them the Devastating Charge special rule.
