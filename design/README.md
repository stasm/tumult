# Tumult â€” A Narrative Campaign for Warhammer: The Old World

## Core Concept

This document outlines a narrative campaign for Warhammer: The Old World, centered on a series of connected battles between rival warlords. The campaign features persistent army rosters that evolve over time and a progression system for your primary hero as they seek to conquer the chaotic Border Princes.

## Design Goals

* **Organic battle formats**: Battle sizes are a direct result of the map situation, creating naturally asymmetrical contests instead of pre-set game sizes.
* **Creative list-building**: Unusual point totals (e.g., 835 points) challenge players to move beyond standard tournament lists and adapt creatively.
* **Multi-army management**: The Regiment system forces a choice between concentrating power in one army or dividing forces for map control.
* **More than just a boardgame**: The map of named locations and simultaneous secret orders create a deep game of prediction, bluffing, and risk.
* **Narrative-driven progression**: Character progression uses a system of evolving traits, often with interesting trade-offs, instead of simple stat increases.

## Design Principles

*   **Bias for Action**: The campaign's primary purpose is to generate Warhammer battles. Rules should always be written to encourage conflict and minimize the possibility of "no-op" turns. When in doubt, err on the side of making a battle happen.
*   **Everything is a Trade-off**: Custom rules, traits, and effects should always have both a benefit and a drawback. There are no purely positive bonuses. This creates interesting choices and avoids simple power creep.
*   **Flavor over Abstraction**: Prefer specific, named, and thematic mechanics over generic, abstract systems. For example, instead of a generic XP system for hero progression, we use a system of unique, named traits that are chosen or acquired. This grounds the mechanics in the narrative.
