# Tumult â€” A Narrative Campaign for Warhammer: The Old World

## Core Concept

This document outlines a narrative campaign for Warhammer: The Old World, centered on a series of connected battles between rival warlords. The campaign features persistent army rosters that evolve over time and a progression system for your primary hero as they seek to conquer the chaotic Border Princes.

## Design Goals

* Organic battle formats: Battle sizes are a direct result of the map situation, creating naturally asymmetrical contests instead of pre-set game sizes.
* Creative list-building: Unusual point totals (e.g., 835 points) challenge players to move beyond standard tournament lists and adapt creatively.
* Multi-army management: The Regiment system forces a choice between concentrating power in one army or dividing forces for map control.
* More than just a boardgame: The map of named locations and simultaneous secret orders create a deep game of prediction, bluffing, and risk.
* Narrative-driven progression: Character progression uses a system of evolving traits, often with interesting trade-offs, instead of simple stat increases.
