# Campaign Turn & Phases

## The Campaign Turn

The campaign proceeds in five phases, forming a complete cycle of planning, action, and resolution.

### Phase 1: Downtime Phase (Private)

Players manage their forces and plan their next moves privately. Players are trusted to keep their own records of Gold, Renown, and their current Army Roster.

* Spend Gold: Replenish losses from existing units or purchase new units for your Army Roster.
* Spend Renown: Upgrade your Hero with new traits.
* Plan Moves: Secretly plan your strategy for the turn ahead.

### Phase 2: Secret Orders Phase

Every player secretly writes down an order for each of their armies (Main Army and any Regiments) and gives it to the GM. The available orders are:

* Move: Move your army from its current Node to an adjacent, connected Node.
* Defend: The army remains in its current Node, preparing for an attack.
* Create Regiment: Split an army. The order must specify which units are being assigned to the new Regiment.
* Merge Regiment: An army and a friendly Regiment in the same Node merge into a single force.

### Phase 3: Order Resolution Phase

The GM reveals and resolves all orders simultaneously.

* Merge/Create Orders are resolved first.
* Defend Orders are resolved next. Armies are marked as defending their Node.
* Move Orders are resolved last. This can result in several outcomes:
  * Uncontested Move: The army moves into a vacant or friendly node successfully.
  * Challenge: An army moves into a node where an enemy is Defending. A battle is initiated.
  * Head-on-Clash: Two armies move to swap nodes (A moves to B's node, B moves to A's). A battle is initiated on the route between them. Each army uses the Supply Value calculated from its starting node (the node it was in before moving), preserving the natural asymmetry of the situation.
  * Contested Target: Two or more armies move to the same destination node. This triggers an immediate Standoff Resolution.

#### Standoff Resolution for Contested Targets

When a Contested Target occurs, the main turn is paused. The involved players must immediately submit a new secret order to the GM from the following options:

* Stand and Fight: The army holds its ground, ready for battle.
* Withdraw: The army immediately retreats to the node it came from.

Resolution:

* If all involved players choose **Withdraw**, all armies return to their starting nodes, and the target node remains neutral or with its previous owner.
* If even one player chooses **Stand and Fight**, a battle is initiated. All armies that moved to the contested node are drawn into the fight, including those that chose to Withdraw. If the node was defended, the defending army also participates. The winner takes control of the node.

### Phase 4: Battle Phase

Resolve all battles initiated in the Order Resolution Phase.

### Phase 5: Resolution Phase (Public)

This phase resolves the results of the turn's actions in full view of all players.

* Update Map: Adjust control of Nodes based on the battle outcomes.
* Award Renown: Heroes involved in the turn's battles earn Renown.
* Collect Revenue: Gain Gold Crowns for each Node you currently control. This income is available to spend in the next turn's Downtime Phase.

## Progression & Victory

* Army Progression: Armies grow by spending Gold on new units for the master Roster.
* Victory: The campaign ends when a player achieves a pre-determined condition: Domination (controlling set territories), Warlord King (eliminating another player), or Timed Victory (most Renown/territories after a set of turns).
