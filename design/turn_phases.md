# Campaign Turn & Phases

## The Campaign Turn

The campaign proceeds in five phases, forming a complete cycle of planning, action, and resolution.

### Phase 1: Downtime Phase (Private)

Players manage their forces and plan their next moves privately. Players are trusted to keep their own records of Gold, Renown, and their current Army Roster.

* Spend Gold: Replenish losses from existing units or purchase new units for your Army Roster.
* Spend Renown: Upgrade your Hero with new traits.
* Plan Moves: Secretly plan your strategy for the turn ahead.

### Phase 2: Secret Orders Phase

Every player secretly writes down an order for each of their armies (Main Army and any Regiments) and gives it to the GM. The available orders are:

* Move: Move your army from its current Location to an adjacent, connected Location.
* Defend: The army remains in its current Location, preparing for an attack. If an army under a "Defend" order is attacked, its player may choose one of the following bonuses before the battle begins:
  * Favourable Ground: You may choose your deployment zone.
  * Prepared Ambuscade: Grant one of your Core units the Vanguard special rule for this battle.
  * Ready for the Assault: You gain a +1 modifier on the roll to determine who takes the first turn.
* Create Regiment: Split an army. The order must specify which units are being assigned to the new Regiment.
* Merge Regiment: An army and a friendly Regiment in the same Location merge into a single force.

### Phase 3: Order Resolution Phase

The GM reveals and resolves all orders simultaneously.

* Merge/Create Orders are resolved first.
* Defend Orders are resolved next. Armies are marked as defending their Location.
* Move Orders are resolved last. This can result in several outcomes:
  * Uncontested Move: The army moves into a vacant or friendly location successfully.
  * Challenge: An army moves into a location where an enemy is Defending. A battle is initiated.
  * Head-on-Clash: Two armies move to swap locations (A moves to B's location, B moves to A's). The battle is fought at the location with the higher base Supply Value. Both armies calculate their supply based on that location.
  * Contested Target: Two or more armies move to the same destination location. This triggers an immediate Standoff Resolution.

#### Standoff Resolution for Contested Targets

When a Contested Target occurs, the main turn is paused. The involved players must immediately submit a new secret order to the GM from the following options:

* Stand and Fight: The army holds its ground, ready for battle.
* Withdraw: The army immediately retreats to the location it came from.

Resolution:

* If all involved players choose **Withdraw**, all armies return to their starting locations, and the target location remains neutral or with its previous owner.
* If even one player chooses **Stand and Fight**, a battle is initiated. All armies that moved to the contested location are drawn into the fight, including those that chose to Withdraw. If the location was defended, the defending army also participates. The winner takes control of the location.

### Phase 4: Battle Phase

Resolve all battles initiated in the Order Resolution Phase.

### Phase 5: Resolution Phase (Public)

This phase resolves the results of the turn's actions in full view of all players.

* Update Map & Retreats: The winner of a battle takes control of the contested location. The losing army's fate is determined as follows:
  * If the Attacker Loses: The attack is repelled. The attacker's army returns to the location it moved from at the start of the turn.
  * If the Defender Loses: The defender's army must retreat to a single, adjacent, friendly-controlled location of their choice.
  * If Retreat is Impossible: If a defending army loses and has no friendly locations to retreat to (i.e., it is surrounded), it is scattered and destroyed. All surviving units from that battle are permanently removed from the player's Army Roster.
* Award Renown: Heroes involved in the turn's battles earn Renown.
* Collect Revenue: Gain Gold Crowns for each Location you currently control. This income is available to spend in the next turn's Downtime Phase.

## Progression & Victory

* Army Progression: Armies grow by spending Gold on new units for the master Roster.
* Victory: The campaign ends when a player achieves a pre-determined condition: Domination (controlling set territories), Warlord King (eliminating another player), or Timed Victory (most Renown/territories after a set of turns).
