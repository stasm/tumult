# Campaign Map & Supply

## The Campaign Map

The campaign is played on a node-based map of named locations (Nodes) connected by Routes.

* Nodes: These are territories with a Supply Value representing the army points they can support. Examples include Villages (250), Towns (500), Fortresses (800), and Capitals (1000 Cap).
* Routes: These are paths that connect Nodes and restrict army movement, creating natural chokepoints.

## Army Management & Supply

* Army Roster: Your single master list of all owned units, which grows with recruitment and shrinks with permanent losses.

* Fieldable Army Size: Determined by the Decimal Contribution System:

  * 100% from the army's current Node.
	* 10% from each adjacent, friendly Node.
	* 1% from each second-degree friendly Node.

* Splitting Forces: You can have one Main Army led by your primary Hero and multiple smaller Regiments led by other characters.

  * When you create a Regiment, you are temporarily assigning units from your master Roster to that new command. Those units are committed to that Regiment and cannot be used by your Main Army or any other force, unless merged back.

## Determining Battle Size

This system ensures every game is a satisfying size while reflecting the strategic situation.

* Calculate Supply: Both players calculate their army size using the Decimal Contribution System.
* Apply 500-Point Floor: If a playerâ€™s calculated Supply is below 500, it is raised to 500. Otherwise, they use their full value.
* Fight the Battle: The battle is fought with these two final, adjusted army sizes.

Example Scenarios:

* Player A (800 Supply) vs. Player B (650 Supply): The battle is 800 vs. 650.
* Player A (700 Supply) vs. Player B (350 Supply): The battle is 700 vs. 500. Player B's army is raised to the floor.
* Player A (400 Supply) vs. Player B (250 Supply): The battle is 500 vs. 500. Both armies are raised to the floor.
