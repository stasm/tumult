# Campaign Map & Supply

## The Campaign Map

The campaign map is divided into several named **Regions**. Each region is a collection of thematically-linked **Locations** that are connected by **Routes**.

*   **Regions**: Groups of locations that, when fully controlled, provide a strategic bonus to the controlling player.
*   **Locations**: These are the individual territories you fight to control, such as towns, strongholds, or mountain passes. Each has a Supply Value representing the army points it can support (e.g., Villages 250, Towns 500).
*   **Routes**: These are the paths that connect Locations, restricting army movement and creating natural chokepoints.

## Army Management & Supply

* Army Roster: Your single master list of all owned units, which grows with recruitment and shrinks with permanent losses.

* Fieldable Army Size: Determined by the Decimal Contribution System:

  * 100% from the army's current Location.
	* 10% from each adjacent, friendly Location.
	* 1% from each second-degree friendly Location.

* Splitting Forces: You can have one Main Army led by your primary Hero and multiple smaller Regiments led by other characters.

  * When you create a Regiment, you are temporarily assigning units from your master Roster to that new command. Those units are committed to that Regiment and cannot be used by your Main Army or any other force, unless merged back.

## Determining Battle Size

This system ensures every game is a satisfying size while reflecting the strategic situation.

* Calculate Supply: Both players calculate their army size using the Decimal Contribution System.
* Apply 500-Point Floor: If a playerâ€™s calculated Supply is below 500, it is raised to 500. Otherwise, they use their full value.
* Fight the Battle: The battle is fought with these two final, adjusted army sizes.

Example Scenarios:

* Player A (800 Supply) vs. Player B (650 Supply): The battle is 800 vs. 650.
* Player A (700 Supply) vs. Player B (350 Supply): The battle is 700 vs. 500. Player B's army is raised to the floor.
* Player A (400 Supply) vs. Player B (250 Supply): The battle is 500 vs. 500. Both armies are raised to the floor.

## Region Control Bonuses

When a player controls all Locations within a single Region, they gain a persistent **Region Control Bonus**. This creates a strong mid-game objective and makes the choice of where to expand a key strategic decision.

The goal is for each bonus to be unique and rooted in the lore of the region itself.

### Region Bonus Design Toolbox

The following are examples of thematic bonuses that can be assigned to specific regions when the map is created.

**Economic Bonuses (The People are Prosperous)**

*   **Breadbasket:** The fertile farmlands of this region are pacified and organized. Gain an additional **100 Gold Crowns** during the Resolution Phase.
*   **Ancient Mines:** By securing these mountains, you have reopened ancient, treasure-laden mines. After any battle you win, you gain an additional **1D6x10 Gold Crowns**.

**Military Bonuses (The People are Martial)**

*   **The Musterfields:** This region is known for its hardy, militant populace. You may reduce the cost of replenishing or recruiting one **Core** unit by up to 50% during each Downtime Phase.
*   **Mountain Fastness:** The locals know every secret path and hidden watchtower. Any friendly army defending within this region's Locations adds a flat **+150 Supply** to its calculated army size.

**Heroism Bonuses (The People are Inspired)**

*   **Land of Legends:** Your leader's deeds have become local legend. Your primary Hero gains **+1 Renown** after any battle they participate in, win or lose.
*   **The Ancient Temple:** This region houses a sacred temple, and by protecting it, you have earned divine favour. Once per battle, a unit joined by your Hero may re-roll a single failed Break test.
