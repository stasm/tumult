# Region Control Bonuses

When a player controls all Locations within a single Region, they gain a persistent **Region Control Bonus**. This creates a strong mid-game objective and makes the choice of where to expand a key strategic decision.

The goal is for each bonus to be unique and rooted in the lore of the region itself.

## Region Bonus Design Toolbox

The following are examples of thematic bonuses that can be assigned to specific regions when the map is created.

### Economic Bonuses (The People are Prosperous)

*   **Breadbasket:** The fertile farmlands of this region are pacified and organized. Gain an additional **100 Gold Crowns** during the Resolution Phase.
*   **Ancient Mines:** By securing these mountains, you have reopened ancient, treasure-laden mines. After any battle you win, you gain an additional **1D6x10 Gold Crowns**.

### Military Bonuses (The People are Martial)

*   **The Musterfields:** This region is known for its hardy, militant populace. You may reduce the cost of replenishing or recruiting one **Core** unit by up to 50% during each Downtime Phase.
*   **Mountain Fastness:** The locals know every secret path and hidden watchtower. Any friendly army defending within this region's Locations adds a flat **+150 Supply** to its calculated army size.

### Heroism Bonuses (The People are Inspired)

*   **Land of Legends:** Your leader's deeds have become local legend. Your primary Hero gains **+1 Renown** after any battle they participate in, win or lose.
*   **The Ancient Temple:** This region houses a sacred temple, and by protecting it, you have earned divine favour. Once per battle, a unit joined by your Hero may re-roll a single failed Break test.
